# Tap Tao To-Do App

Welcome to the To-Do App project! This project is built using **React Native**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **TypeScript**, as part of a coding test for the company Tap Tao. Below are the instructions and information required to run and evaluate the app.

## 1. Project Overview

This is a simple **To-Do app** that allows users to:
- View a list of to-do items.
- Add, delete, and update to-do items.
- Assign priorities to the to-do items (High, Medium, Low).
- Sort the to-do items from high to low priority.
- Customize the priority indicator with colors or icons.
- Smooth UX with layout animations using **Reanimated**.

### Features:
- **Priority-based sorting**: The items are sorted by priority (High > Medium > Low).
- **Animation**: Using **Reanimated** for smooth UI updates (e.g., when an item is added, deleted, or updated).
- **Performance**: Optimized for handling large lists efficiently.
